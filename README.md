- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CodingElec, an electrical engineer who should be building transmission lines but likes coding too much.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the Backend in general, mostly software architecture, Go and Node / Typescript.


I do not make a lot of side projects public, but I will always leave at least 1 for the sake of it.
