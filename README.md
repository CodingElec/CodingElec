- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodingElec, an electrical engineer who should be building transmission lines, but likes coding too much.
- 👀 I’m interested in the Backend in general, mostly software architecture and Node / Typescript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun project without tight deadlines, I leave those for work. 
- 📫 How to reach me the social media that pointed you here would do the trick.
